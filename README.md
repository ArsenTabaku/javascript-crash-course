# What is this repo about?

This repo is created to learn the important "tools" in Javascript for coding. With tools we refer to
conditional-statements, loops, string, arrays etc. Every "tool" is organized in folders and include two 
JS files, one where we can learn about that "tool" and the other one where we can actually practise through
exercises.
